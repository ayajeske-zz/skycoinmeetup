# Skycoin Meetup

Wiki for managing content related to community growth of Skycoin Project.


## Intro

Skycoin is a great technology and a revolutionary suite of tools that have the potential to create a fairer, uncontrollable and decentralized internet.
In order for the project to succeed we need to create awareness and gain increasing support from the community.
Although, the tech is top notch, the marketing efforts so far have been leading to underwealming results. 
__The reason for that lies within the peculiarities of Skycoin itself.__

Differently than all other projects out there, Skycoin has a pretty mature tech-stack already in production or close to delivery.
Using the same marketing strategies of ICOs is counterproductive as they focus primarily on eliciting contributions from retail investors rather than creating the foundation for a steady and solid organic growth.

This is why, rather than engaging in _shill groups_, conference hopping, ads and flashy PR, we are probably going to achieve a more stable and durable support through one of the underutilized tools for organic awareness and quick community buildup: **meetups**.

## Strategy
In order to create a real movement instead of flashy headlines, we are going to exploit an educational delegation methodology. In an effort to keep the dev team as focused as possible on the technology, the awareness creation around the Skycoin ecosystem is going to be delegated to a few community leaders in charge of meetups organized and deployed territorially in as many different regions as possible.

To go viral you need almost a military style operation in which devs are left developing while respecting timelines as much as possible and other people take away from them the burden of constant content creation, launch groundwork prep., PR&press, social hacking and community building, biz. partnership, evangelism, consulting, government support, etc.

### Network of Meetups
Given the "meshy" nature of the Obelisk consensus algorithm, having multiple Meetups collaborating with each others, has the advantage not only of educating people about the vision and the project, but would also translate into activities with the potential to enable the creation of geographically distributed Skycoin nodes as well as Skyminers (e.g. through hands-on workshops).

### Support From The Core Developers
Each meetup event should be treated as a launch event. Skycoin blog should speak about it, people in telegram and the other channels should be notified and encouraged to join. Also, content creation should not be a responsibility of the Meetup team but the content (as in presentations, videos, graphic elements and workshops) should be supplied by a specific team under the direct dev team oversight. This would take an enormous load off the local teams, which task should primarily be to take care of the event logistics, establish local partnerships, enroll developers, encourage new projects to adopt the stack and increase attendance.

### Consistency of the curriculum
It is essential that the message would be kept consistent. Everybody should be on the same page about:
* the end vision
* how the technology works
* the financial incentive
* the current status
Given the above points, it is important that the activities within the Meetups would not be confined solely to boring presentations or pedantic powerpoints, but would include hands-on workshops on the different side of the technology. In that respect, well thought hackathons could be very interesting. Some examples of activities:
- Installing a node
- Create a CX-based smart contract
- Demonstrate a demo ICO, which token distribution is based on CX programming language
- Animation of how Obelisk works
- Persisting data on CXO
- Assembling a Skyminer
- Joining the testnet (as soon as it is running)

### Meetup Team
Having good teams on the territory is key for the success of the meetup. Ideally, the team managing a local meetup, should include 2 or 3 members with different competencies. Good candidates are skycoin enthusiasts with a good network and some experience in at least two of the following:
* public speaking
* community building
* IoT/blockchain development
* tech blogging
* software consulting
* project management
* event management
* crypto trading
* social marketing
The drive for many people would mainly be VANITY. Equipping people with material and launching them on stage is a powerful motivator. 
The more important they feel, the more they have the impression that they belong to an inner circle (hence the importance of communication with the Dev Team), the more they will advance the proposition, shill their performance to their grandma
and talk relentlessly about it

### Partnerships
Partnerships are essential both to get logistic support and also to spread awareness even further. The best profile for partners would be
* __Local Mid-Sized Consultancy Businesses__: Many of these companies want in in the blockchain frenzy. They get asked more and more by clients “how can we exploit blockchain tech” and have no clue where to start. Many will help with places for hosting the events and will invite their prospects for no other reasons than to seem well informed
* __Blockchain Meetups__: The best instrument to test potential attendance would be to do guest starring on other meetups. I would avoid Crypto trading and instead concentrate on those build around "Blockchain" as they normally tackle different aspects and are always happy to have their speaker's slot covered
* __IoT Meetups__: Many IoT meetups are crawling with people in search for a good project. These are hands-on people that will love to get on board, build skyminers and support the network. Most importantly, these people normally have a lot of knowledge in Wireless transmission which would come in handy for generation 2 of skyminers.

### Planning

In terms of planning we need to
- have the flow questions answered
- think of a list of people here that can help
- coordinate the message with the writers and the designer
- iterate the powerpoint into a story that is consistent with the highlighted goals
- start to reach out to the relevant people
- sort out logistics (as in a meetup team, the right venue, partnerships and additional speakers)
- coordinate with all the social channels to do the launch countdown
- do the damn thing
- get in touch with other cities
- rinse and repeat

## Content Strategy Board

In this board we keep the tasks related to the general content strategy for the Skycoin community building activities. 
It is supposed to be the main point of reference for tasks that need to be completed in order to outline a coherent, consistent, clear and simple roadmap for content divulging.

### Link
The content strategy board can be found (by people with the right permission) [here](https://trello.com/b/zCygtIgK)

### Task management
Tasks need to contain a clear description and links to resources to be used. Preferrably, resources should be kept in the [Skycoin Meetup Github Repository](https://github.com/ayajeske/skycoinmeetup).

## Meetup Event Board
This board contains tasks specific to an event.
